# Wind Power Forecasting [AI and Climate Change Course on Coursera]

Our paper, 'Wind Power Forecasting Using Multi-level Adaptive Graph Convolution Neural Networks', published in the international MDPI Energies journal, was inspired by the Coursera course 'AI and Climate Change'. This course greatly enhanced my understanding of renewable energy systems and the application of AI for forecasting. The knowledge and skills I acquired through the training were instrumental in developing and publishing our paper. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in being at the forefront of AI in energy systems.
